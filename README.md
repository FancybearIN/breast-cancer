# Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

### Implemented by Gurnoor Kaur

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with Keras and TensorFlow to detect breast cancer. The implementation is based on the paper "Cancer diagnosis in histopathological image: CNN based approach" published in Informatics in Medicine Unlocked Volume 16, 2019, 100231.
